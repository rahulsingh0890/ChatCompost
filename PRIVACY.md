# Privacy Policy — ChatCompost

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

## Data Collection

ChatCompost **does not collect, use, or share any user data**. No personal information, conversation content, browsing history, or usage analytics are gathered.

## How It Works

The extension runs entirely in your browser. It adds checkboxes to your ChatGPT and Gemini conversation lists, allowing you to select and delete multiple chats at once. All actions happen locally on your device — nothing is sent to any external server.

## Data Sharing

No user data is shared with any party. There are no third-party services, analytics providers, advertising networks, or external servers involved.

## Permissions Used

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Access the current ChatGPT or Gemini page to add checkboxes and delete selected conversations |
| Host permissions (`chatgpt.com`, `gemini.google.com`) | Run the extension on ChatGPT and Gemini websites |

No permission is used to access, collect, or transmit user data.

## Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be reflected here with a revised date.
